# 2DOALs
Codes for the paper 'Fractional corner charges in spin-orbit coupled crystals' (Phys. Rev. Research 1, 033074, (2019)).

# What's here?
Mostly Mathematica, MATLAB and Python scripts for studying single layers of bismuth/antimony within Liu-Allen model (Phys. Rev. B 52, 1566 (1995)). Some toy models will be added soon.

# Methods
Tight-binding models for different geometries: fully translational (Bloch) and finite flakes.
